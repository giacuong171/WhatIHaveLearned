#Non-redundant-gene : A non-redundant gene refers to a gene that is essential for a specific biological process and doesn't have redundant backup copies or overlapping functions provided by other genes in the genome.
  
#Intergenic: Refers to the regions of DNA located between genes on a chromosome. No protein-coding genes in this regions but might still have important function. 

#BAF: B-allele frequency simply refers to the fraction of reads supporting non-reference alleles at a given SNV position. This measure can be extracted from aligned alleles at each position with SNV call and helps to define CNV regions.  (Used for CNVkit, CasPer)
