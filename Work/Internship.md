## CircRNAs
1. Definition:
	- Type of non-coding RNA molecule that forms a covalently **closed continuous loop**. 
	- Generated from precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) through a process called *back-splicing*, where a downstream splice donor site joins with an upstream splice acceptor site, resulting in a circular molecule.
2. Paper summary:
	1. Abstract:
		- circRNAs associated with CNS disorders (aberrant wake-sleep cycle) 
		- Aiming to quantify the daily expression changes of circRNAs
		- Hypothesize that the expression changes of Cdr1as in the SCN, particularly during the dark phase, are associated with light-induced phase shifts. 
		- Time component must beb considered when studying circRNA regulation
	2. Introduction:
		- **SCN** : Suprachiasmatic nucleus is the central circadian pacemaker.
