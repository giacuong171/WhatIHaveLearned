# WhatIHaveLearned
I created this repository to store my knowledge. I believe that everyone will forget what they have learned if they don't touch it frequently. The only parts that we remembered  were interesting bullet points, sometimes nothing. However, if you have a space to read back what you have learned, that memory will be activated. I hope I can frequently contribute to this repo as long as I still can learn new things.
